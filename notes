Notes:
estimator = PoseNet
refiner = PoseRefineNet

Main:

Sets parameters based off of what dataset is used
Creates models
If resume, get old parameters
Load in dataset and create train/test dataloader

for epoch in epochs:
    for rep in repeated epoch:
        forward pass estimator, get loss
        use refiner to refine points for opt.iterations
        save network weights every 1000 forward passes of data

    basically repeat above for test data
